# Comparison of Drawing System Approaches



| Feature / Criterion         | Approach 1: Image Processing & Contour Grouping | Approach 2: Object Detection + ROI Contour Processing | Approach 3: Object Detection + Database Mapping |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Method**             | Edges &rarr; Contours &rarr; Group by Proximity &rarr; Simplify &rarr; Line Commands | Detect Object &rarr; Isolate ROI &rarr; Edges (in ROI) &rarr; Contours (in ROI) &rarr; Simplify &rarr; Line Commands | Detect Object &rarr; Map Class Label &rarr; Lookup Pre-defined Scaled Commands |
| **Required Input Files**    | None (beyond code & libraries)                  | YOLO Model (.cfg, .weights, .names)                   | YOLO Model (.cfg, .weights, .names), Shapes Database (.py file) |
| **Drawing Output**          | Simplified outline of perceived shapes (can be complex or simple based on tuning) | Simplified outline of perceived shape *within the detected box* | Pre-defined, abstract simplified shape from database (scaled) |
| **Flexibility (What can be drawn)** | Potentially any object with detectable edges (if filters/grouping work) | Only objects detectable by the model, but draws their *actual* visible outline | Only objects detectable by the model *AND* for which a shape exists in the database |
| **Robustness to Background Clutter** | Low (filters help, but complex backgrounds can still interfere with contour finding/grouping) | High (processing is confined to the detected object's bounding box) | High (detection isolates the object, background is ignored) |
| **Handling of Object Orientation** | Works on 2D projection; relies on contour finding to follow rotated edges; may struggle with complex rotations. | Relies on detection model's robustness + processes ROI contour as seen; better than Appr 1 but still draws 2D projection. | Relies on detection model's robustness for detection; the drawn shape is the *same* pre-defined abstract shape regardless of the object's rotation in the frame. |
| **Performance / Speed**     | Moderate (Image processing can be computationally intensive) | Moderate (Object detection adds overhead, but ROI processing is faster than whole-image processing) | Fastest (Detection is done once per interval, lookup is very fast) |
| **Complexity (Implementation & Tuning)** | High (Complex multi-stage image processing pipeline, many interdependent parameters, tricky grouping logic) | High (Adds model handling and detection *before* the ROI processing pipeline, still requires parameter tuning) | Moderate (Model handling, detection, database lookup. Complexity shifts to creating and maintaining the shape database.) |
| **Key Benefit**             | Can attempt to draw *any* visible outline.     | Draws the perceived outline of *detected* objects, ignoring clutter. | Fastest processing, provides clean, consistent, abstract representations of known objects. |
| **Main Limitation**         | Highly sensitive to image noise, lighting, and background complexity; difficult to reliably isolate one object. | Limited to objects the detection model knows; the quality of the outline depends on the image quality *within* the detected box. | Limited to the specific object classes in the database *and* the quality of the pre-defined shapes; cannot draw objects not in the database; drawing is not the object's actual outline. |
